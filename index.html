			Rihanna is a Barbadian singer, songwriter, actress, and businesswoman. Her full name is <strong>Robyn Rihanna Fenty.</strong> She was born on February 20, 1988, in Saint Michael, Barbados. She began her music career in 2003 with the release of her debut album, “Music of the Sun”, which featured the hit single “Pon de Replay”. She then released several successful albums such as “A Girl Like Me” (2006), “Good Girl Gone Bad” (2007), and “Rated R” (2009) which included hit singles such as “SOS”, “Umbrella”, “Take a Bow”, “Disturbia”, “Only Girl (In the World)”, “We Found Love” and “Diamonds”. 
		<br><br><br>
			Rihanna's childhood was marred by her father's struggles with addictions to alcohol and crack cocaine and her parents' marital problems. When Rihanna was 16 years old, she left Barbados to move in Connecticut and work on recording a demo album. "When I left Barbados, I didn't look back," Rihanna recalled.

			<strong>"I wanted to do what I had to do, even if it meant moving to America."</strong>"
			In 2005, her song Pon de Replay was in the top five of the summer music charts of fifteen countries, among which we can mention the UK Singles Chart and the Billboard Hot 100. She reached the number one spot in the Hot Dance Club Songs. By August of that same year, Rihanna released her first album, Music of the Sun, with which she obtained the gold certification of the Association of the record industry of the United States because it sold more than half million units. Rihanna also sang her album at the pre-gala of the MTV Premios Video Music Awards that same year.</p>

		<p>At the 2023 Superbowl, Rihanna made <strong>an exceptional comeback after seven years.</strong> With number 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 she is the No-3 artist with the most number 1 songs ahead of Michael Jackson, Madonna
			and Janet Jackson, making her the youngest and fastest solo artist to ever hit that number.
			She is the only artist that produced number-one singles on the Hot 100 chart from seven consecutive albums! Rihanna shaped the texture and taste of the air by consistently doing what pop, at its very best, is supposed to do: taking disparate genres — rock, EDM, dancehall, trap and even dubstep — and turning them into something that makes sense to us, to everyone.
			Rihanna has the unique ability to sing in a high whistle tone, also known as her head voice. This technique she has perfected over time and it now forms an important part of her soundscape. She has a powerful, dark tone in her voice which perfectly complements the lyrics she crafts.

		Rihanna started off her career making her money through her music and touring. Eventually, she earned enough to purchase the masters of her music which enabled her to earn even more royalties and streaming revenue. Through the years she's also appeared in movies which added to her empire.
		But her net worth really took off when she launched businesses. The bulk of her earnings come from her stake in Fenty Beauty. But revenues from Savage X Fenty, and Fenty Skin are what helped her cross the billion dollar mark, to become the richest female musician, and second-richest female entertainer, behind Oprah. The diversification of her revenue streams continues, as the singer has filed patents within the last year for Fenty Kids and Fenty Hair.<strong> She became America's youngest self-made female billionaire in 2022.</strong>
		She's been named a “fashion icon” by the Council of Fashion Designers of America and had fashion collaborations with the likes of Armani and Puma, been a brand ambassador for fashion houses like Dior.
